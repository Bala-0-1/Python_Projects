# You are given a sequence of directions represented as a string. Each direction can be one of the following: 'U' (up),
# 'D' (down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right). Your task is to determine if the sequence of directions forms a closed path, meaning that it starts and ends at the same point.
# Write a function that checks if the given sequence of directions forms a closed path.
